# Caesar Cipher

The Caesar Cipher project is a Python implementation of a classic encryption technique. It utilizes a simple substitution method where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

This project demonstrates proficiency in various programming concepts such as list comprehension, loops, input and output handling. List comprehension is used to efficiently manipulate lists, while loops are employed for iterating through the input data and performing the encryption process.

The project takes user input for the plaintext message and the desired shift value. It then encrypts the message according to the Caesar Cipher algorithm and outputs the encrypted text.

Usage
1.Clone or download the repository.
2.Open the main.py file in Visual Studio Code.
3.Run the program from the terminal and dive into the fun of Caesar Cipher.
